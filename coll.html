            <h3>What is Chlorophyll Printing?</h3>
            <p>
                Chlorophyll printing is the organic technique 
                of bleaching the magnesium present on 
                chlorophyll, leaving an image on the leaf. 
                In inspiration of such, I took the opportunity 
                to make my own chlorophyll prints electronically
                in memorium of the victims of the Kent State Massacre
                that took place May 4, 1970.
